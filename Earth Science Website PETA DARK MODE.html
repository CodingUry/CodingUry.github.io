            <div style="max-width:1000px; word-wrap:break-word; color:white;">As time passes, humanity has proven itself extraordinarily dominant—so dominant, in fact, that we have become a threat to ourselves. One big telltale sign of this phenomenon is the disastrous effects of our turning a blind eye to the dissipation of the ice glaciers. We have become so focused on our individualism that we have failed to grasp the bigger picture. Self-destruction has become second nature to us; simply put, we humans are a very resourceful species. But we tend to overlook the resolution that our actions hold; our cognitive biases simply block us from getting a good glimpse in retrospect. Although human expansion has led to us being able to step foot on the moon, our line of thinking simply ignores the contrary. When faced with a reality we cannot accept, our minds wander to find ways to cope with what’s presented. Additionally, actions have consequences, and here is just a glimpse of what is in store for the future...</div>
            <div style="max-width:1000px; word-wrap:break-word; color:black;">blankblankblank</div>
	    <div style="max-width:1000px; word-wrap:break-word; color:white;">The effects of our glaciers and ice caps melting do not only affect a singular area but the whole world, as they are responsible for rising sea levels that, when time passes, can submerge lowlands to their depths. Not only that, but it can elevate storm surges as warming air and ocean temperatures create more frequent and intense coastal storms like hurricanes and typhoons. The disappearance of glaciers also has a huge impact on our climate, for glaciers have white surfaces that reflect the sun's rays. This helps keep our current climate mild or ‘do-able’ as of the moment for more world problems to affect our climate. When glaciers melt, darker surfaces are exposed, which absorb heat. This raises temperatures even more. What’s more saddening is its effect on arctic animals like the polar bear, walruses, arctic fox, and many more, thus its effect on us humans.</div>

	    <div style="color:white;"><h1>Conclusion</h1></div>
            <div style="color:white; max-width:1000px; word-wrap:break-word;"><p>In conclusion, humanity's actions can lead to the demise of ice glaciers, which has been classified as a "disaster," and can endanger humanity itself. Natural disasters such as storm surges, sea level rise, and climate change are all contributing factors in the melting of glaciers. The sudden increase in our temperature due to climate change is slowly melting the ice caps, making sea levels rise. This has a major effect on life in the Arctic, like polar bears, walruses, and arctic foxes. Due to cognitive biases, humanity's disregard for ice glaciers dissipation results in global implications and disasters including increasing sea levels, hurricanes, and global warming, harming arctic species and humans as a result.</p></div>
